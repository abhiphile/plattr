# plattr
Everything on one platter – orders, deals & growth

A unified, AI-powered assistant that empowers merchants to manage all their aggregator platforms (Swiggy, Zomato, Magicpin, ONDC, and more) from a single conversational interface. The Merchant Assistant automates operational tasks, provides proactive alerts, and surfaces actionable insights—helping merchants save time, reduce errors, and maximize revenue.

---

## 🚀 Objective

**Merchant Assistant** solves the chaos of multi-platform management for merchants by:
- Providing a single conversational interface (WhatsApp, Claude, or Web Bot) for all merchant operations.
- Securely logging into partner portals and executing merchant commands (change offers, opt in/out of promotions, run campaigns, update timings, etc.).
- Using agentic AI to autonomously complete complex, multi-step tasks and proactively alert merchants about anomalies, opportunities, and trends.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **Conversational Interface:** Interact via WhatsApp, Claude, or Web Bot.
- **Unified Platform Management:** Update offers, timings, and campaigns across Swiggy, Zomato, Magicpin, ONDC, and more.
- **Secure Portal Integration:** Securely log in and perform actions on partner portals.
- **Agentic AI:** 
  - Autonomously completes multi-step tasks (e.g., "Run a weekend discount similar to my last Diwali promo").
  - Proactively alerts merchants about anomalies (deductions, rating drops), seasonal opportunities, and competitor trends.
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Detects and notifies about operational issues before they impact revenue.

## 🤖 Browser Automation Setup

Some platform actions (such as logging into Swiggy, Zomato, or Magicpin portals) are performed using a Python-based browser automation agent.

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3 and pip installed. Then run:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Variables

The `.env` file should include your OpenAI API key and database URL, which are used by both the Node.js and Python services.

### 3. Running Browser Automation

The browser automation agent is invoked automatically by the backend when required.  
You can also run it manually for testing:

```sh
python3 scripts/browser_agent.py '{"task": "login", "platform": "swiggy"}'
```

### 4. Automated Setup

You can use the provided setup script to automate the above steps:

```sh
bash setup-browser-automation.sh
```

This will:
- Install Python and Node.js dependencies
- Create a `.env` file if it doesn't exist
- Remind you to update your API keys and database URL

---

**Browser automation endpoints:**
- `POST /api/platforms/connect` (with browser automation)
- `POST /api/platforms/action` (with browser automation)
- `POST /api/browser/execute` (direct browser tasks)
- `GET /api/tasks/:taskId` (check task status)

---

## 🏁 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm (v9+)
- PostgreSQL database (Neon or local)
- [Optional] OpenAI API key for AI features

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/plattr.git
cd plattr
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
PORT=8080
```

### 4. Database Setup

Run migrations and seed data:

```sh
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
```

### 5. Start the Development Servers

#### Backend

```sh
npm run dev:server
```

#### Frontend

```sh
npm run dev:client
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

- **Dependencies:** Keep all dependencies up to date. Run `npm audit` regularly.
- **Testing:** All new features must include tests. Use integration tests for platform actions.
- **Documentation:** Update this README and inline code comments with every major change.
- **Monitoring:** Set up error and performance monitoring for both server and client.
